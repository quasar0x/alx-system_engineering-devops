# Postmortem for Web Stack Outage

## Issue Summary
- **Duration:** May 10, 2024, 02:00 AM to 04:30 AM UTC
- **Impact:** Website was completely down, affecting 100% of users. Users experienced 503 Service Unavailable errors.
- **Root Cause:** Database connection pool exhaustion due to an unoptimized query in the authentication service.

## Timeline
- **02:00 AM:** Monitoring alert received indicating increased error rates.
- **02:05 AM:** On-call engineer receives alert and begins investigation.
- **02:10 AM:** Initial hypothesis that the web server is overloaded. Web server logs show no significant issues.
- **02:20 AM:** Database team investigates potential issues. Misleading logs suggest possible DDoS attack.
- **02:40 AM:** Database connection metrics show connection pool exhaustion.
- **03:00 AM:** Incident escalated to the senior database engineer.
- **03:15 AM:** Identified unoptimized query causing high load.
- **03:30 AM:** Temporary fix applied by restarting the database server.
- **04:30 AM:** Permanent fix deployed by optimizing the problematic query.

## Root Cause and Resolution
- **Root Cause:** An unoptimized SQL query in the authentication service was causing excessive database connections, leading to connection pool exhaustion.
- **Resolution:** The problematic query was optimized to reduce the load on the database. Additionally, the connection pool size was increased temporarily to handle the load until the query optimization was deployed.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures
- **Improvements:**
  - Conduct a thorough review of all SQL queries in critical services.
  - Implement better monitoring for database connection metrics.
- **Specific Tasks:**
  - [ ] Optimize identified unoptimized SQL queries.
  - [ ] Increase connection pool size in the database configuration.
  - [ ] Add detailed logging for database query performance.
  - [ ] Implement alerts for high database connection usage.
